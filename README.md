Web client for BananaHackers Store

![shields.io Last Commit badge](https://img.shields.io/github/last-commit/bananahackers/store)

## Features

- List apps from [BananaHackers' main GitLab store-db](https://gitlab.com/banana-hackers/store-db) instance, or the [community mirror on GitHub](https://github.com/bananahackers/bananahackers.github.io) & filter apps.
- View apps information.
- Download apps manually, or by using clients supporting QR codes with `bhackers:<app-name>` scheme .

## Building

The WebStore can be run directly from `src/index.html` in this Git repository. For GitHub pages hosting, you will need to build it (run these commands relative to the project directory):

- Install build dependencies:
```bash
npm install -g gulp-cli
npm install
```
- Build the project:
```bash
gulp
```

and of course enable GitHub Pages and set it to host from `docs/`. You will need to run the 'Build the project' step every commit to have the changes from `src/` be reflected on GitHub Pages.
